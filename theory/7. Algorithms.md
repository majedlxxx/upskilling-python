# Algorithms and Big O notation.

### Big O notation / Time Complexity

* Big O notation is a measurement used to measure the time complexity of an algorithm
* It's used to count the number of mathematical or comparison operations done code to reach a conclusion.
* It's not measured by a fixed number for example 10 million operations instead we say it n operations where n represents the size of an input.
* It's important to always consider the worst case scenario when assessing an algorithm.
* For example in the function below the worst case scenario is to have to loop over all the list to find out that the integer doesn't exist.
* In the below example we say that the function has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the list.

```python
def search(l: list, n: int) -> int:
    """
    this function takes a list (l) and an integer (n) and searches for the integer 
    n in l and returns it's index or -1 if n is not found
    """
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i] == n:
            return i
    return -1 # Not found

```

* Fixed number of operations will always be considered O(1)
* let's assume that the complexity is n + n^2 + 1  we say it's n^2(we only include the largest notation)
* We don't include multiples for example 3n or 1/2n we just say O(n)
