### Interpreted VS Compiled:
* Compiled:
    * Eg: C/C++, C#, JAVA, GO ...etc
    * You don't run the code directly. You compile it first.
    * Compiling a code => getting a binary file(eg: exe) out of a source code.
    * Usually faster.
    * Checks for syntax errors before compiling.

* Interpreted:
    * Eg: Python, Bash, ruby ...etc
    * You do run the code directly.
    * No compilation needed.
    * Usually slower
    * Runs line by line so it will only stop when there is an error. ****
