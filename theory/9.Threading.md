# Threading
### What is threading
* Threading helps us having multiple codes running simultaneously  / in parallel.
* For example we can have a code that add data to a certain queue and another piece of code that processes this data.
* When using multiple threading, threads share data(variables, lists, queue)
* Using multithreading means that we can take advantage of our multi core Processors to perform operations/computations in parallel.
