# How does the web work
![Web](Images/HTTP.png)

* Protocol: It's a set of rules that multiple entities can use to exchange data.

* Back-end server can be developed using different programming languages: eg: PHP, C#/.net, Ruby, Python, Javascript(NodeJS) etc..

* Front-end / Client-side code: Can be a code that runs in your Web Browsers(written in HTML, Javascript and CSS) or Desktop/mobile applications can be written using other programming languages eg: Flutter, Unity, Java, Python, Swift etc...

* Static files: these files include media files(images, icons, videos, pdf files, exe files etc..), css, javascript and html codes etc.. (usually public files).

* Dynamic data: is data that is stored in a SQL or NoSQL databases we use some kind of queries to retrieve this kind of data from databases.

# HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
* HTTP is a protocol that specifies how can data be transferred between the server and the client(Web Browser / Mobile application)
* HTTP Request(The message sent by our web browser) main elements:
    1. URL
    2. Method (eg: GET, POST)
    3. Payload / data / request body.
    4. Headers.

### URL
![URL Structure](Images/URL.png)

### Methods
* Method specify how the is being sent to the server. For eg in HTML the default behavior for forms submitted using POST requests is to send data within the request body as seen in the image below but when using GET method the data is being within the URL's parameters segment as seen below.
![POST Request data](Images/post_data.png)
![Get Request data](Images/get_data.PNG)
* Most common HTTP Methods and when to use them (Note that html only recognizes GET and POST methods However other methods can be used using Javascript):
    1. GET: Retrieve data. eg: search. view profile.
    2. HEAD: Similar to GET, but it will only return the headers / not the content (More on that when explaining the HTTP Response).
    2. POST: Send data / Create objects. eg: Login(sending username/password), Signup(Creating a profile)
    3. PATCH: Update data eg: Update Profile(Change phone no)
    4. DELETE: Delete data eg: delete account/profile/image etc...
    5. OPTIONS: Get allowed HTTP Methods.
    6. PUT: For uploading files.


### HTTP Payloads
* This is the date sent to the server usually used with POST. PATCH, PUT.
* Don't confuse HTTP Data/ payloads with the parameters that are sent within the URL.
* This data can take different shapes:
    1. JSON Data (Very similar to python's dictionary) (application/json). eg: {"username": "admin", "password": "1234"}
    2. form-data (Usually used with HTML forms) (multipart/form-data or application/x-www-form-urlencoded) => eg: username=admin&password=1234
    3. XML (rarely used)
    4. Bytes/raw data(for files) eg: image/png, image/gig, audio/webm, application/pdf

### Headers
* Headers: consist of extra information sent to the back-end server that specify information about the client, the data sent, browser info, security related details, etc...
* Most common headers:
1. Content-Type: used to specify the content that you are sending in the HTTP payload. (Most common types are mentioned above.)
2. User-Agent: Used to specify the browser/Operating system used by the client. For example user-agent is used by google.com to return different html codes depending in your OS for example: Android vs Windows, another example is how websites for example Microsoft teams will give you an option to download different versions of the App based on your Operating system.



### HTTP Response
* HTTP Response(it's the response sent back to the browser) main elements:
1. Response header: Meta data about the response data.
2. Response data.
3. Status code.

### Status code.
* It's a numeric code 100-600 (official ones).
* each hundred represent a certain category:
    1. 100-200 informational (Rare).
    2. 200-300 Successful request.(the HTTP request has been processed without issues):
        * 200 OK
        * 201 CREATED: when something you asked for was created successfully(Eg: create profile, upload file, post a tweet.
        * 204 NO CONTENT: we got a response back but without data(response size: 0).

    3. 300-400 Redirection: It's used when the user is redirected to another web page(eg: visiting facebook.com from your smartphone will redirect you to m.facebook.com)
        * More on that later.

    4. 400-500 Client Side error(The HTTP request is malformed / follows incorrect format etc ....)
        * 400 BAD REQUEST: (Sending unexpected data that cannot be understood by the backend server for example sending username and phone_no to a login API where the backend was expecting username/password combo) or having a syntax error with the sent data (eg: forgetting a comma when sending json object)
        
        * 401 UNAUTHORIZED: Not logged in (eg: trying to access mywebsite.com/my-profile without logging in) / Backend doesn't know my identity.

        * 403 FORBIDDEN: Despite being logged in you don't have access to certain data. (Eg: accessing a private profile for someone who is not your friend on Facebook / accessing someone's profile when you are blocked). the backend recognize my identity but I am not allowed to access the requested resource.

        * 404 NOT FOUND: Try to access a resource that doesn't exist. eg: trying to access https://google.com/fjdkfjdkfjdkj

        * 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED: Using methods that are not allowed on a certain URL API(eg: curl -X POST https://www.google.com/search?q=car) the search API for google only accepts GET requests when send a POST request using curl (More on that later) we get back a 405 error.

        * 408 REQUEST TIMEOUT: This usually caused by a slow internet connection. servers usually have timeout set for http connection establishing mechanism. for example if the browser took a minute to establish connection with google.com Google will shutdown the connection



5. 500-600: Server side errors

    * 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR: Internal code/server related issue has happened.
    * 501 NOT IMPLEMENTED: There a URL available for the API, but the feature is not implemented yet.
    - Gateways act as a middleware between the user and the server (Eg: nginx(more on that later))
    * 502: BAD GATEWAY: this means that the gateway forwarded the user's request to the server but the server sent back a response that was not understood by the gateway.
    * 504 GATEWAY TIMEOUT: the gateway received the user's request and forwarded it to the server but the server didn't response within a certain time limit(eg: 30 seconds)
