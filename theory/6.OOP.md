# Object Oriented Programming
* Create my own type of data.
* Classes contain data, and functions (functions within clasess are called methods)
* Everything is an object in python. Eg: int, str, float, function, list, dict, etc...
* We can use the function type(object_name) to get it's class
* we can use isinstance(object_name, class_name) to get True if the object is an instance of a class.
* Magic attributes (attributes starting with __ and ending with __ ):
```
    __doc__
    __dict__
```

* Magic Methods (Methods starting with __ and ending with __ ) / can be used to override methods: 
```
    __str__
    __add__
    __sub__
    __mult__
```

* Class attributes:
```python
    print(class_name.__dict__)
```

* Object attributes:
```python
    print(object_name.__dict__)
```

* Class level attributes vs Object level attribute
```python
class Test:
    x = 0 # class level attribute / shared between all Test objects / can be used as a static variable
    def method(self):
        self.y = 0 #Object level attribute / Unique for each object
    

```

* Static variables in classes
    * Variables that are static for all the objects of a certain type(class)


* Static Methods

* Inheritance:
    * Inheritance is used when we have multiple classes that share common attributes and methods
    * Parent class / base class / super class => is the class that we inherit attributes and methods from.
    * Child / sub class(es) => are clasess that inherit the super classes.
    * Inheritance can always be refrenced by using the verb is. for example: the instructor(child class) is an employee(super class)
    ```python
    class ChildClass(BaseClass):
        pass
    ```


* Setter and getters
