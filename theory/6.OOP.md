# Object Oriented Programming
* Create my own type of data.
* Classes contain data, and functions (functions within clasess are called methods)
* Everything is an object in python. Eg: int, str, float, function, list, dict, etc...
* We can use the function type(object_name) to get it's class
* we can use isinstance(object_name, class_name) to get True if the object is an instance of a class.
* Magic attributes (attributes starting with __ and ending with __ ):
```
    __doc__
    __dict__
```

* Magic Methods (Methods starting with __ and ending with __ ) / can be used to override methods: 
```
    __str__
    __add__
    __sub__
    __mult__
```

* Class attributes:
```python
    print(class_name.__dict__)
```

* Object attributes:
```python
    print(object_name.__dict__)
```

* Class level attributes vs Object level attribute
```python
class Test:
    x = 0 # class level attribute / shared between all Test objects / can be used as a static variable
    def method(self):
        self.y = 0 #Object level attribute / Unique for each object
    

```

* Static variables in classes
    * Variables that are static for all the objects of a certain type(class)

* Class Method
    * We transform methods into class methods using @classmethod decorator.
    * Class methods accept cls as their first parameter. cls represents the class itself.
    * Class methods are usually used to instantiate object(s) form another data types(eg: excel sheet, tupe, dictionary etc..)
    ```python
    class test:
        def __init__(self, name, id):
            self.name = name
            self.id = id
        @classmethod
        def new_object_from_tuple(cls, t: tuple):
            # t => (name, id) eg: ('Majed', 115)
            return cls(t[0], t[1])

    ```
* Static Methods:
    * we turn a method into a static method by using the decorator @staticmethod
    * Static methods don't receive any special parameters eg: self, cls
    * Used when we want to add extra functionalities related to the class. but not dealing with the class itself of any object.
    ```python
    class student:
        def __init__(self, id, name, joining_year):
            self.id = id
            self.name = name
            self.joining_year = joining_year
        @staticmethod
        def check_minimum_requirements(age, high_school_avg):
            """
                Students are only eligible to join  if:
                1. they are at least 17 years old
                2. high school average > 65
            """
            if age >= 17 and high_school_avg >= 65:
                return True
            else:
                return False 
    ```



* Inheritance:
    * Inheritance is used when we have multiple classes that share common attributes and methods
    * Parent class / base class / super class => is the class that we inherit attributes and methods from.
    * Child / sub class(es) => are clasess that inherit the super classes.
    * Inheritance can always be refrenced by using the verb is. for example: the instructor(child class) is an employee(super class)
    ```python
    class ChildClass(BaseClass):
        pass
    ```


* Setter and getters
