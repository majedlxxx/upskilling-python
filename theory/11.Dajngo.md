# What is Django?


## MTV
* Model: class that represents the Database structure(table) (ORM Object-relational mapping)
* Template: Front-end / HTML/CSS/Javascript / Jinja
* View: Data Processing.

* Eg: A user logging in:
    1. User navigates to the /login page using GET request:
        - Django will check urls.py and call the View(Function) that is mapped to the "login" URL.
        - The View will render an HTML page(Template) and return it to the user.
    2. The user enters his username/password and submits the form:
        - The form (in template) will send a POST request to the url "/login" containing the user's username/password.
        - Django will check urls.py and call the View(Function) that is mapped to the "login" URL.
        - The view function will check that the data is sent correctly (eg: the user should get an error if only the username was sent(without the password)) if the data is valid the view function will check with the database using models.
        - If the username and password are correct then redirect the user to the home page. else return an error for the user.


## Databases in Django:
* Using ORMS/Models we create a django model (class)
* We create migrations: migrations are scripts that will modify and update the database.
* We apply the above migrations to the database: translating the generated scripts into SQL Queries that will modify the database
## Django setup and installation:

## Django main commands:
* Creating a django project:

```bash

```

* Creating an App:

```
* Running the app
```
python3 manage.py runserver 
```
* Creating migrations
```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations app_names(optional)
```
* Applying migrations
```bash
python3 manage.py migrate app_names(optional) migration_id(optional)
```
* python shell
