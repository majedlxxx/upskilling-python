# VS Code shorcuts:
* ctrl + arrow => to move the cursor faster(word by word instead of character by character)
* ctrl + shift + arrow => to highlight a word
* Home => to go to the start of the line
* End => to go to the end of the line

* shift + home + arrow => higlight the line starting from the cursor's position to the start of the line
* shift + end + arrow => highlight the line starting from the cursor's position to the end of the line

* shift + arrow(up/down) => to highlight multiple lines
